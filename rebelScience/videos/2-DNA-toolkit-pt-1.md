# DNA Toolkit Pt. 1

DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid.  
Double stranded DNA.  
The most common form of DNA is B-form DNA.  
Each strand is a **polynucleotide**.  

**nucleotide**:
- 3 components
- 5 carbon sugar, phosphate group, one of four possible nitrogenous bases
- nitrogenous base is always attached at the 1' carbon of the sugar
- there is a phosphate between the 5' carbon of one sugar and the 3' carbon of the neighboring sugar...
- the sugar is called deoxyribose bc it is missing a OH (hydroxyl) group at the 2' carbon which is present in ribose.


4 nirogenous bases:
- adenine
- guanine
- cytosine
- thymine 


Nucleotides attach to each other by **phosphodiester** bonds.   
- the sugars and phosphate groups make up the DNA backbone
- on the top strand, the order is always 5' -> 3' for the carbons making the phosphodiester bond
- on the bottom starnd it is 3' -> 5'

The two strands interact via **hydrogen bonds** from hydroxyl groups on the bases! 
Each base forms multiple hydrogen bonds with its **complementary base** on the opposite strand.  
Each unit is called a **base pair**.  

**the hydrogen bonding contributes to the specificity of base pairing**.
- T --> A (2 hydrogen bonds)
- C --> G (3 hydrogen bonds)

pyrimidines:
- thymine and cytosine 
- single ring structure

purines:
- adenine and guanine
- double rings 

each turn of the helix measures approximately 10 base pairs.
